# python-mie
Pure Python package for Mie scattering calculations. This package is used by,
for example, the [structural-color python
package](https://github.com/manoharan-lab/structural-color).

The original code was developed by Jerome Fung in the [Manoharan Lab at Harvard
University](http://manoharan.seas.harvard.edu). This research was supported by
the National Science Foundation under grant numbers CBET-0747625, DMR-0820484,
DMR-1306410, and DMR-1420570. The code has since been updated. It now works in
Python 3, and it can handle quantities with dimensions (using
[pint](https://github.com/hgrecco/pint)).
